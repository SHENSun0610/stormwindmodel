\title{Calculate wind speed at grid points}
\usage{
calc_grid_wind(grid_point = stormwindmodel::county_points[1, ],
  with_wind_radii = add_wind_radii())
}
\arguments{
\item{grid_point}{A one-row dataframe with the grid id, latitude, longitude,
and population for a single grid point of the projection grid.}

\item{with_wind_radii}{A dataframe with interpolated tracks for a storm,
including wind radii, as created by \code{add_wind_radii}.}

\item{gust_duration_cut}{The wind speed, in meters per second, to use as a
cutoff point for determining the duration of gust winds. The function
will calculate the minutes during the storm when surface-level gust winds
were above this speed at the location.}

\item{sust_duration_cut}{The wind speed, in meters per second, to use as a
cutoff point for determining the duration of gust winds. The function
will calculate the minutes during the storm when surface-level gust winds
were above this speed at the location.}
}
\value{
Returns a one-row matrix with wind characteristics for a single
   location. The wind characteristics given are:
   \itemize{
     \item{\code{max_gust}: Maximum value of surface-level (10 meters)
       sustained winds, in meters per second, over the length of the
       storm at the given location}
     \item{\code{max_sust}: Maximum value of surface-level (10 meters)
       gust winds, in meters per second, over the length of the
       storm at the given location}
     \item{\code{gust_duration}: Length of time, in minutes, that
       surface-level sustained winds were above 20 meters per second}
     \item{\code{sust_duration}: Length of time, in minutes, that
       surface-level gust winds were above 20 meters per second}
   }
}
\description{
This function uses the Willoughby wind model to calculate wind speed at
a grid point location. This function calculates wind characteristics at
just one location, and then it is applied to all grid locations in a higher-
level function (\code{get_grid_winds}).
