\title{Impute hurricane tracks to finer time scale}
\usage{
create_full_track(hurr_track = floyd_tracks, tint = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{hurr_track}{Dataframe with columns the hurricane track for a single
storm. This must include columns for date-time (year, month, day, hour,
minute; e.g., "198808051800" for August 5, 1988, 18:00 UTC),
latitude, longitude, and wind speed (in knots). The column
names for each of these must be "date", "latitude", "longitude",
and "wind".}

\item{tint}{Interval (in hours) for the estimates. Default is 0.25 (i.e., 15
minutes)}
}
\value{
The function returns an extended version of the track data, with
   latitude, longitude, and wind speed linearly interpolated between
   observed values. Also, wind speed is converted in this function to m / s
   and the absolute value of the latitude is taken (necessary for further
   wind speed calculations). Finally, the names of some columns are
   changed ("tclat" for latitude, "tclon" for longitude, and "vmax"
   for wind speed.)
}
\description{
This function takes data on a hurricane's track and imputes to fill in
values at a finer time resolution. For example, if the hurricane tracks
are recorded at 6-hour intervals, this could be used to impute locations
and windspeeds at 15-minute intervals.
}
\details{
The function does a simple linear interpolation, both for location
and for wind speed, between the measured observations in the input
hurricane track data.
}
\note{
This function imputes between each original data point, and it starts
   by determing the difference in time between each pair of data points.
   Because of this, the function can handle data that includes a point
   that is not at one of the four daily synoptic times (00:00, 06:00, 12:00,
   and 18:00). Typically, the only time hurricane observations are given
   outside of synoptic times for best tracks data is at landfall.

After imputing the tracks, longitude is expressed as a positive number.
   This is so the output will work correctly in later functions to fit the
   wind model. However, be aware that you should use the negative value of
   longitude for mapping tracks from the output from this function.

data("floyd_tracks")
full_track <- create_full_track(hurr_track = floyd_tracks)

# Interpolate to every half hour (instead of default 15 minutes)
full_track <- create_full_track(hurr_track = floyd_tracks, tint = 0.5)
