Description: This package allows you to input tracking data for a hurricane
    or other tropical storm, along with a dataframe of grid points at which
    to model wind speeds, and functions in this package will calculate wind
    speeds at each point based on wind model equations. This work was supported 
    in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health 
    Sciences (R00ES022631) and the National Science Foundation (1331399).
